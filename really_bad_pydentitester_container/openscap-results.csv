                        auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit
                        information. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit
                        records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit
                        information system activity.

                        To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed in order
                        to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been

                        leverages multiple functions in the running kernel through the Linux

                        opening sockets, and accessing files.

                        Linux containers utilize the host's kernel, making it impossible to install
                        and operate a separate auditing package inside the container itself.
                        Instead, auditing information must be configured and collected through the
                        audit configuration of the host.

                        Once configured, logs of container actions are written to the host's audit
                        log files and are readable only by the host superuser account. These logs
                        must be collected from the host for incident response and reporting. Storage
                        capacity limits, audit process monitoring, remote upload of logs and

                        access to system resources such as system memory or cpu utilization. Cgroups
                        protect the host resources and other containers running on the host from
                        being impacted by Denial of Service attacks on a targeted container.
                        Together, namespaces and cgroups isolate security functions of the host
                        operating system from nonsecurity functions of applications running inside
                        the container. The separation makes it possible for container failures to
                        not directly impact the operation of the host and its security functions
                        when caused through processing of invalid inputs or other runtime errors. In
                        the event of a container failure during initialization, shutdown, or abort,
                        the host operating system's security capabilities will continue to function
                        as configured.

                        Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous
                        constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control
                        imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another
                        subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits
                        the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity
                        level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the
                        information is passed outside the control of the information system,
                        additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect.
                        While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access
                        control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not
                        required for this use of discretionary access control.

                        opening sockets, and accessing files.

                        and operate a separate auditing package inside the container itself.
                        Instead, auditing information must be configured and collected through the
                        audit configuration of the host.

                        Once configured, logs of container actions are written to the host's audit

                        and operate a separate auditing package inside the container itself.
                        Instead, auditing information must be configured and collected through the
                        audit configuration of the host.

                        Once configured, logs of container actions are written to the host's audit
                        log files and are readable only by the host superuser account. These logs
                        must be collected from the host for incident response and reporting. Storage
                        capacity limits, audit process monitoring, remote upload of logs and
                        associated alerts are the responsibility of the host where the containers
                        are running.

                        For more information on inherited controls for containers see the DISA
                        Container Hardening Process Guide.

                        and 3) Something you are (e.g., biometric). A non-privileged account is any
                        information system account with authorizations of a non-privileged user.
                        Network access is any access to an application by a user (or process acting
                        on behalf of a user) where said access is obtained through a network
                        connection. The DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor

                        to pass information to any other operating system admin or user.","Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on
                        the notion that individual users are ""owners"" of objects and therefore have
                        discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which
                        mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence
                        of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the
                        owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example
                        of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. When discretionary access
                        control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard
                        to what actions they can take with information for which they have already
                        been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to
                        information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the
                        discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject
                        that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is
                        still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this
                        requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints
                        preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating
                        at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to
                        pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The

                        Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when
                        placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an
                        organization's automated account management requirements. Account management
                        functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account
                        type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account
                        removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of
                        automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging
                        to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or
                        transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and
                        using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account
                        usage.

                        application-specific time services. In cryptographic systems with a
                        hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a
                        certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not derived. A root
                        certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store
                        or certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates. 
                        Script Verification:
                            To manually verify, Ensure the ca-certificates package has not been
                        modified using apk audit or by ensuring the sha256 value matches the trusted
                        value.
